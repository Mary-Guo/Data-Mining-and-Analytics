Some pointers of how you could go about this question are listed below:\n","    - ```yelp_businesses = yelp_dataset.groupby('business_id').size() ```\n","    - The `.size()` function counts the number of instances for each `business_id`, which gives us the number of reviews as each instance in this dataset is a review.\n","    - The following command will sort this list, after which you can take note of the highest value: ```sorted_yelp_businesses = yelp_businesses.sort_values(ascending=False, inplace=False)```\n","    - This approach allows you to see the data structure being used in the sort.
