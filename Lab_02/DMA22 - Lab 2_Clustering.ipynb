The columns are named as q1, q2....etc. A description of the features can be found at this link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18wwyjGku2HYfgDX9Vez64lGHz31E_PfbpmAdfb7ly6M/edit?usp=sharing\n","\n","## Working on the assignment / FAQs\n","- **Always use the seed/random_state as *42* wherever applicable** (This is to ensure repeatability in answers, across students and coding environments).\n","    - This can typically look like taking in another argument `random_state = 42` when applicable.\n","- The points allotted per question is listed.\n","- To avoid any ambiguity, each question also specifies what *value* the function must return. Note that these are dummy values and not the answers themselves.\n","- If a question has multiple answers (due to differences in handling NaNs, zeros etc.), all answers will be considered.\n","- Most assignments have bonus questions for extra credit, do try them out! \n","- You can delete the `raise NotImplementedError()` when you are attempting the question.\n","- **Submitting the assignment** : Save your work as a PDF (Print -> Save as PDF), download the `.ipynb` file from Colab (Download -> Download as .ipynb), and upload these two files to Gradescope. **Run all cells before submitting.**\n","- **MAKE A COPY OF THIS FILE FOR YOURSELF TO EDIT/SAVE.**\n","- That's about it.
