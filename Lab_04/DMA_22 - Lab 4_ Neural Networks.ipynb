Also I observed the parameters they choose in the paper is also small like 8. So I started with 8 hidden layer sizes and 16 max iter (double amount of the hidden layer sizes), and played around it. The final hidden_layer_sizes I chose is 10, and max_iter is 22. Also, I found out if I add two more hidden layers(second layer size is 6, the third layer size is 2), it will gives me the same accuracy 0.8619246861924686"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"NNfqvIv-30uk"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
