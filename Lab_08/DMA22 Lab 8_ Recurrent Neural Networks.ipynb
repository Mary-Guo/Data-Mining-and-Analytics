Firstly I increased the epochs to 110, and the accruacy went up, but the prediction result is not good. So I changed the number of memory cells to 210, and added the dropout rate equaling to 0.2. It gives me a better result. However, when I changed the sequence length from 10 to 20, the accuracy goes up to almost 1, but the prediction result is not good. So I changed it back to sequence length of 10. Overall, I think the reason why the the third prediction result (Hello world) is not good because our trainset is small, and it's not a modern text, it's a ancient poem. So the model have never seen the modern English in the training, that's why it couldn't give a better prediction."],"metadata":{"id":"bpIUoR1WrZmU"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#4 New Text, and a
